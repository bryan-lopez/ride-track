### HW #5 by Bryan Lopez

Hello! Today we analyzed Pyber's sampled data in certain parts of the country. The sampled data contains information pertaining to three parts of the country: Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. In each of these areas, we have a collection of towns, the amount of Pyber drivers in the area, and a snapshot of that area's average ride.

As we begin to analyze the data, the first trend to point out is the relationship between the amount of trips and the average fare price. Rural areas tend to have the highest cost trips, but also the fewest amount of trips. On the other side of the scale, we have Urban areas where the average cost of trips is much lower, but there are many more of them. Suburban areas fall in between both Rural and Urban areas in both respects.

Unsurprisingly, we notice that the Urban areas vastly surpass both Rural and Suburban areas in total drivers, total fares, and total amount of trips.

An interesting final trend to note is the dominance in the amount of Urban drivers compared to Suburban and Rural areas. In the first two pie charts, we can see how, despite the lower amount of rides (\~30%), Rural and Suburban areas can generate a significant portion of revenue (\~35%) when compared to Urban areas. Urban areas contain a higher density of drivers for a much lower payoff when compared to Suburban and Rural areas. This makes sense when we consider the competition in the areas. This also points to a possible accessibility issue where Pyber can expand into if they have the resources necessary. Further research would help point out or dissect the competition in each area.
